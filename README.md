# WTWR (What to Wear?)

## About the project

The idea of the application is pretty simple - we make a call to an API, which then responds with the daily weather forecast. We collect the weather data, process it, and then based on the forecast, we recommend suitable clothing to the user.

5. I can't like items. When I click on the button, they disappear from the page
6. The item modal doesn't open when I click on the items which are on the profile page. See the errors
7. You need to fill the profile inputs with the user data when you open the profile modal, to let the user edit the data and submit it.
8. When I edit the profile data, all my items and profile data disappear from the page
9. I can't delete items. The error says that I'm not authorized
10. Please, show the delete item button only when the user is logged in, because you can't delete not your own items
11. Please, make the delete item button match the design. It should be red, and it should be in the right part of the card bottom
