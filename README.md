# WTWR (What to Wear?)

## About the project

The idea of the application is pretty simple - we make a call to an API, which then responds with the daily weather forecast. We collect the weather data, process it, and then based on the forecast, we recommend suitable clothing to the user.

  Code Reviewer comment:

6. Please, show the delete item button only when the user is logged in, because you can't delete not your own items
7. When I edit the profile data, all my items and profile data disappear from the page
8. You need to fill the profile inputs with the user data when you open the profile modal, to let the user edit the data and submit it.
